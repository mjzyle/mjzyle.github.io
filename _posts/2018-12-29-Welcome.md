Hello and welcome to my blog! I owe many thanks to the [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) team for providing a great framework for getting this blog up and running. 

A little about myself: I've just finished my final undergraduate semester at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, where I studied Computer Engineering and English. I have a range of interests in both hardware and software; however, the latter is definitely my main passion, particularly computer graphics and entertainment-related technologies.

This blog will primarily be a means of tracking my progress on a number of personal projects. However, I will also plan on writing about interesting developments in the field or some of my experiences as a newcomer from time to time. My current project is something I'm calling [ZRender](https://github.com/mjzyle/zrender), a name that's currently misleading as it isn't actually a renderer.
