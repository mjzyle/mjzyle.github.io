title: Lights, Camera, Action! Part 1

*This is part of an ongoing blog series following my progress on [ZRender](https://github.com/mjzyle/zrender), a custom OpenGL rendering and development framework.*

Welcome back! I'm happy you'll be following along with my progress, and I hope you'll stick around to see some of the exciting ideas I have in mind come to life. 

To get there, I've decided to first focus on writing a relatively simple OpenGL framework that I can use as a base for my future projects (affectionately titled *ZRender*). I've found that a lot of my work in OpenGL involves a lot of time spent doing basic setup work over and over again from project to project - things I may or may not actually remember how to do each time I sit down to program! The typical early workflow then becomes looking through old projects to see how I solved problems, refactoring code, trying to figure out why the refactored code won't work, looking up tutorials online, realizing the tutorials are using different toolsets than I am, downloading new libraries...

I decided I want to be done with that, so I'm taking it slow and starting from the ground up this time. And the more I thought about it, the more I realized that my main objectives for having ZRender are summed up pretty well by a familiar filmmaking phrase:  lights, camera, action!

So, in no particular order, here are my immediate goals for ZRender as I've been approaching the project:
* Lights: 
* Camera: 
* Action:
